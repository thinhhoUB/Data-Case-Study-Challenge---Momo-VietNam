> - During the month of April, I have come across an interesting Case Study of Momo - a leading fintech company in Vietnam. Thanks to it, I have an opportunity to solidify my Data Analysis skill by answering business related questions as well as develop the project more away in business use cases and reccomendations. 

> - I use Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) as a primary language for the project on the Jupyter Notebook. First part of the project, I perform the **Data Preprocessing** such as joining across tables to aggregate and calculate the needed information. Second part of the project, I perform the Exploratory Data Analysis to analyze some trends of the program and finally suggest a solution to reduce the operation cost but increase the retention rate of the customers. For a better understanding, please look at the notebook I have attached and leave any reccomendation.
